# IG

This Implementation Guide (IG) contains a Logical Model representation of a simple DHIS2 Tracker Program. The IG is designed to showcase how FHIR Mapping Language (FML) can be used to convert the logical model of a DHIS2 Tracker Program into a FHIR Patient resource.

The guide provides all the necessary tools and files to try out FML to map DHIS2 metadata to FHIR resources. Follow the instructions in the README set up your environment, compile the IG, and run transformations using the FHIR Validator CLI.
